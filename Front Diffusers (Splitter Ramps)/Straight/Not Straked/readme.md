# Straight Splitter Ramp - Not Straked

This is a straight splitter ramp/diffuser. This part is 12 inches by 7 inches internal as required by the SCCA Time Trials 84 sqin rule. This does not include a strake. This design is based on the concept that more exposed surface area could speed up more air and create more downforce versus the straked version. This has not been verified or tested in CFD.

The number at the end of the file indicates the flange height from the bottom. So if you have a 0.5 inch thick splitter you should choose the 0_5 file as this will put your ramp flush with the bottom of your splitter.
