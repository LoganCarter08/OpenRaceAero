This is a straight splitter ramp/diffuser with an added strake in the center. This part is 12 inches by 7 inches internal as required by the SCCA Time Trials 84 sqin rule. The strake may not be important for efficiency, but the design took inspiration from rear diffusers. There may be some side flow that could interact with the ramp and this may make it nice to have, but that has not been verified with CFD. 

The number at the end of the file indicates the flange height from the bottom. So if you have a 0.5 inch thick splitter you should choose the 0_5 file as this will put your ramp flush with the bottom of your splitter.
