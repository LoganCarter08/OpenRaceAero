This is a slightly curved splitter ramp. This part has an internal area of 84 sqin as required by the SCCA Time Trials. Some popular diffusers and ramps are made with a curve to them so that air can expand in two axis instead of just one. This may be beneficial compared to straight, but that has not been verified with CFD. 

The number at the end of the file indicates the flange height from the bottom. So if you have a 0.5 inch thick splitter you should choose the 0_5 file as this will put your ramp flush with the bottom of your splitter.
