# Curved Splitter Ramp

This is a slightly curved splitter ramp. This part has an internal area of 84 sqin as required by the SCCA Time Trials. Some popular diffusers and ramps are made with a curve to them so that air can expand in two axis instead of just one. This may be beneficial compared to straight, but that has not been verified with CFD. 

The number at the end of the file indicates the flange height from the bottom. So if you have a 0.5 inch thick splitter you should choose the 0_5 file as this will put your ramp flush with the bottom of your splitter. 

I wrote an article for designing and building V1 and V2 that you can find [here](https://theracingprogrammer.substack.com/p/diy-splitter-ramps-diffusers).

## V1 

V1 was a spitball design based with squared edges and was essentially a first pass attempt at making splitter ramps. 

## V2

V2 is a slightly refined version of V1. This design has been refined by using data found by [Wavey Dynamics](https://www.waveydynamics.com/post/diffusers). This adds beveled edges and a beveled trailing edge.

For V2 there is only a model designed for 3D printing into 4 pieces with a 1/8" height flange.
