# Semi Circle Splitter End Plate

This design is based on [this article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-aero-note-fs-car-part-2-vortices-diffuser-design-joe-wong/?trackingId=jkbw%2FO77q%2BjgMKHIZCOqew%3D%3D).

While the design in the above link feature as canard on the vertical upright, this does not. This is due to the class rules that I enter not allowing a canard to be close to the splitter or attached to it (SCCA Time Trials). This design may benefit from the canard if others are looking for ways to improve it. Also, the diameter of the semi circle may not be optimal. This size was estimated from the images in the above link.
