Open aero is an attempt to upload aerodynamic devices for track cars on a budget. Aerodynamic parts are very expensive and this is often why amateur racing series only allow minimal amounts of it. However, it doesn't need to be expensive. Yes, to reach the top level of performance would take hours and hours of development from aerodynamicists, but as a community we have the opportunity to build and test together to implement high quality parts on a budget. These parts will likely be a starting place for anybody looking to either develop their own parts or create physical, functional aero devices on a budget. If you run any CFD analysis or real world testing on any of these parts please let me know.
